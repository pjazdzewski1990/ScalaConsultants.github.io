Building cross platform applications was always a hot topic (write once, run anywhere). The bigest problem is a hybrid app performance... The solution provided by flipboard developers is just awesome! They are using Canvas with ReactJs to deliver Native-like experience - must-read position!

<p id="7"></p>
* \[Functional Programming\] [The World Is a Functional Program](http://www.baweaver.com/blog/2015/02/20/the-world-is-a-functional-program/)
