Hi folks!

Did you miss us The Digest? Because this week we would like to inspire you with some intersting articles devoted to programming. We would like to inspire you and help you in becoming better programmers, that's why we have chosen some great topics about Macros, Reactive Streams, Monads and mobile architecture for you to learn and grow. 

<p id="1"></p>
* \[Scala\] [Exploring Scala Macros: map to case class conversion](http://blog.echo.sh/2013/11/04/exploring-scala-macros-map-to-case-class-conversion.html) 

The article above is a nice explanation of Macros. If you didn't use this useful feature of Scala before, here's a chance for you. And you can trust us, it's not not so hard as you might think.

* \[Scala\] [Akka's Reactive Stream Implementation](http://bryangilbert.com/blog/2015/02/04/akka-reactive-streams/index.html) 

Reactive Streams are a hot topic right now. If you would like to start working with stream, this article is a great place to start. Bryan Gilbert explores the akka-stream library and in a few simple words explains who, how and why can benefit from this technology.

* \[Functional Programming\] [Monoids, Functors, Applicatives, and Monads: 10 Main Ideas](https://monadmadness.wordpress.com/2015/01/02/monoids-functors-applicatives-and-monads-10-main-ideas/)

This article drops the dreaded "M" more than a few times ... but fear not. This post will help you to understand the key ideas behind building blocks of functional programming.

* \[Mobile\] [How NativeScript Works](http://developer.telerik.com/featured/nativescript-works/) 

Recently Facebook astonished us all, when they pushed Javascript onto mobile platforms while keeping it efficient. That's kind of a magic. Aren't you curious how does it really work? Take a look into the magical world of NativeScript.

* \[Android\] [An Investigation into Flow and Mortar](http://www.bignerdranch.com/blog/an-investigation-into-flow-and-mortar/) 

Switching to Android from Scala might be painful. You have to drop many useful programming concepts, go back to writing bloated Java classes and the API feels just sad. Apparently the guys and gals at Square feel the same, so the published two nice libraries, that aim to simplify using Android fragments and structuring applications.
