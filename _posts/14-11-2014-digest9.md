Hi folks! 

{INTRO}

* \[Erlang\] [What can I only do in Erlang?](http://erlang.org/pipermail/erlang-questions/2014-November/081570.html)

Quick intro to Erlang. Must-read before starting of a new project.

* \[Scala\] [Sources, Sinks and FlowGraphs](http://typesafe.com/blog/sources-sinks-and-flowgraphs)

Intro to new Akka Streams API.

* \[Architecture\] [LMAX trading platform](http://martinfowler.com/articles/lmax.html)

This article is a detailed description of LMAX retail financial trading platform. The maker faced a very tough problem, they had to ensure extremely high throughput with low latency, while keeping concurrency under control. The result is a super efficient open source tool called LMAX Disruptor. Definitely worth checking out. 

* \[Biotechnology\] [Open Source Worm](http://www.openworm.org/)

Very ambitious project, that we would like to support at least by spreading the word. A group of scientists and enthusiasts are trying to build a simple life form inside the computer. The big picture is that, if we can simulate a simple and well described organism using computers, we can get a better insights into how our own bodies and brains work. Really groundbreaking.

* \[Functional Programming\] [RX-fy all the things!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gs2irb0f-7o)

Reactive Programming is booming. It's everywhere - in your browser, on the backend and even in your mobile device. This talk is an argument for using reactive approach during mobile development. It explains how we can solve complex problems using relatively simple functional tricks.

* \[Concurrency\] [Concurrency Options on the JVM](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yhguOt863nw)

This JVM focused talk describes various tactics for dealing with concurrency. It shows both advantages and trade-offs of traditional models as well as modern actor/channel based approaches. In a simple way the author explains abstract concepts and things we should consider when designing a complex concurrent system.
