Scalar is a one day [Scala related conference](http://scalar-conf.com/) organised in Warsaw, Poland. It's only the second year it's organised, but it already gained a lot of traction, bringing together both great speakers and knowledge hungry particpiants. After this years edition we concluded that, the polish Scala community is growing stronger and stronger every year and Scalar is the best indicator.  

## <a name="what-we-learned" href="#what-we-learned">What we learned</a>

We started with Adam Quentin, CEO of Clever Cloud, talking about different approaches to streaming with Scala. He discussed [Play's Iteratees and Enumerators](https://www.playframework.com/documentation/2.2.x/Iteratees), [scalaz streams](https://github.com/scalaz/scalaz-stream) and [Akka streams](http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka-stream-and-http-experimental/1.0-M2/scala.html).

Next was Paweł Dolega who talked about graph databases. He introduced the audience to the concepts of [blueprints](https://github.com/tinkerpop/blueprints), being a common standard for graph oriented databases, and (gremmlin)[https://github.com/tinkerpop/gremlin/wiki] which is a handy graph traversal language. He also gave a nice demo which you can checkout [here](https://github.com/nexelem/graphs-gremlins).

Later Adam Warski and Tomasz Szymański told us about [Supler](https://github.com/softwaremill/supler). Supler is a tool that simplifies form handling and validation in an end-to-end fashion. The idea sounds interesting and we're waiting for implementations backed with React.js and Angular.

Next our teammate Radek Tkaczyk gave an practical talk about Slick, benefits of using it and some common pitfalls. ???

After that the stage was given to Typesafe Senior Director Jamie Allen who gave a brilliant talk about how concurrency, parallelism and immutability are the cornerstones of future computing. First he discussed some technical details, that many people don't consider when creating software and then he described the "Mutability Matrix of Pain" in which he shown four main ways of handling state in Scala.

After the break, Heather Miller a PhD student from EPFL told us about her project for Function Passing. She suggested a new approach to computing, where we could benefit from data locality by sending functions to data instead the other way around (as we do now in the actor model). She argued that we could create performant and safe computing platforms if we would switch from sending heavy data to sending simple functions, that transform the data. That's an interesting idea and we are curious on how will it work in practice.

Next we had a very practical talk given by Tomasz Kogut on how he had introduced Akka to his company in order to create a highly-performant solution for the Telco industry. ????

If you still think people using *the m word* are crazy or tired of reading about burritos, you should've seen Paweł Szulc's talk, where he explained monads the right way. Starting from concrete problems, he offered concrete solutions and then extracted the underlying general pattern.

Laskowski???

Mauch ???

Next presenter was Jon Pretty a well known Scala hacker and author of [Rapture](http://rapture.io/) library. He has shown us the real power of Scala type system. In his impressive talk he has exaplained to us how Rapture uses types to improve error handling. He introduced [Modes](https://github.com/propensive/rapture-core#modes) and the idea of improved exception handling. He argued that exceptions should be checked (so the code is safer), monadic (so we could use them in for), dependently typed (in order to catch different error types) and delimited (so we could catch many errors at once). He really gave us something to think about

The last talk was given by Konrad Malawski, who work in Typesafe working on Akka. In his talk Konrad shed some light on brand new experimental features of Akka - streams and [Akka Typed](http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/snapshot/scala/typed.html). Well ... the future of Akka surely looks type-safe :)

In short - we had a great time on Scalar and hope to see you all next year. 

Special kudos to organizers, partners, speakers and all who made this real. You rock!
