Hi folks! 

Welcome to another edition of Scalac Weekly Digest. In the fifteenth edition we will focus on Functional Programming and programming in general. We hope that, you will get inspired by and learn something from the content we shared with you all. 

* \[Functional Programming\] [On Currying and Partial Function Application](http://www.vasinov.com/blog/on-currying-and-partial-function-application/) 

The purpose of this article is to elaborate on Currying and Partial Application, show the relationship between this terms, how they differ and (most importantly) how you can use them in your Scala code. It will surely help you in creating better code.

* \[Functional Programming\] [The imminent revolution of functional append-only databases](http://2014.flatmap.no/speakers/lilleaas.html)

We added this interesting talk to digest, because it shows how our current approach to storing data might be turned upside down, when we apply functional concepts to it. And by "upside down" we don't mean worse or strange .... but practical and efficient.

* \[Javascript\] [The Two Pillars of JavaScript — Pt 2: Functional Programming](https://medium.com/javascript-scene/the-two-pillars-of-javascript-pt-2-functional-programming-a63aa53a41a4)

Javascript guru Eric Elliott describes how functional approach might change frontend programming, for better. Also make sure to check out links provided by Eric, you won't be dissapointed.

* \[Programming\] [Code so good that became legacy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YruzQgWdv48)

Usually Legacy sounds very bad. In this speach you will gain positive perspective on it and how too write so good code that could become legacy. 

* \[Working\] [Code Review Checklist](http://blog.fogcreek.com/increase-defect-detection-with-our-code-review-checklist-example/)

Code Review might be a great tool for learning and improving coding standards in a project, but it works only if done properly. In order to remember about all the necessary things it's good to have a checklist. The link above will show you how a PR checklist could look like. Very practical. 

* \[Machine Learning\] [Facebook - machine learning magic](http://www.infoworld.com/article/2871752/machine-learning/facebook-open-sources-its-machine-learning-magic.html)

Facebook is well known for their policy of releasing code as open source. This time this IT gigant open sourced their machine learning tools. It's always worth to check what tools the best are using.
