The technology is changing rapidly, both when it comes to software and hardware. Although we work mostly with software, it's always good to take a look at the underlying hardware and ask yourself "How does it affect my program?". Here's a lenghty article describing some of the revolutionary changes that happened in last 10-20 years in hardware and debunking common myths.

* \[Working\] [7 Git personalities, which one are you?](https://about.gitlab.com/2015/01/27/7-git-personalities/)
