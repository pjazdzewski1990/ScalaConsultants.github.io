Hi folks!

Welcome to this week issue of Scalac Weekly Digest. We hope you enjoyed the last issue, because this time we have more cool things to share with you. In this edition we will share with you some tricks in Scala and Clojure, show you a neat project created by researchers at DARPA, help you understand Event Sourcing better and complain a bit about Docker. We hope you enjoy it. See you next week.

* \[Scala\] [Scala in Large scale systems](http://www.infoq.com/articles/Scala-Series-Part-1) 

Interview with Andrew Jayne, senior software developer at McLaren Applied Technologies. Read the article if you want to know why they chosed Scala for data analysis tools in Formula 1 industry.

* \[Scala\] [Abstract Algebraic Data Type](http://bertails.org/2015/02/15/abstract-algebraic-data-type)

This blog post explains what Abstract Algebraic Data Types are and how we can use and implement them in Scala.

* \[Robotics\] [DARPAâ€™s HAPTIX project hopes to provide prosthetic hands with sense of touch](http://robohub.org/darpas-haptix-project-hopes-to-provide-prosthetic-hands-with-sense-of-touch/) 

We live in a world where technology gives us endless possiblities. Project HAPTIX aims to help people who lost their limbs and have to live with prosthetic limb systems. Researchers at HAPTIX want to make those prosthetics more like natural body parts by providing way to "feel" with the artificial body part.

* \[Clojure\] [Guide to learning clojure](http://www.lispcast.com/ultimate-guide-to-learning-clojure-for-free) 

Set of links to articles which provide interesting informations about Clojure language. If you are at the beggining of the Clojure-programming-way this article will be very handy.

* \[Clojure\] [Six Unusual Reasons Why Clojure Is a Delight](http://deliberate-software.com/unusual-reasons-why-clojure-is-a-delight/)

Maybe these reasons help you with choosing Clojure as a next language to learn?

* \[Event Sourcing\] [Event Sourcing at Global Scale](http://krasserm.github.io/2015/01/13/event-sourcing-at-global-scale/)

This article describes core issues you may face when designing event-sourced system in distributed environment. Architecture of lightweight re-implementation of akka-persistence API is outlined shortly. This covers concerns such as preserving happends-before relationship and conflict resolution among a few others.

* \[Docker\] [Lets review.. Docker (again)](http://iops.io/blog/docker-hype/)

Author of this blog post used it when Docker was 1.0 and disliked it for multiple reasons (usability, purpose, security and more). But as time goes by, he wanted to give a chance to Docker once again. Take a look to see if Docker is ready for production and where it should really be used.

* \[Docker\] [Boycott Docker](http://www.boycottdocker.org)

Interesting comparison between Docker and Virtual Machines in general comparing to real world problems and usage of both.

* \[Code Quality\] [Find More Bugs with Mutation Testing ](https://gofore.com/ohjelmistokehitys/find-bugs-mutation-testing/) 

Most of programmers write unit tests. We do that to improve the quality, find bugs when they occur and to prevent regression. But how do we know that the tests that we are writing are helpful and really do what intended? Mutation testing is an handy tool that allows us to validate our tests and make sure they aren't just noise
